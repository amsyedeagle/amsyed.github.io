<p> I graduated high school in the summer of 2021, earning my diploma. I'm currently pursuing an Associates in Cybersecurity at Wake Tech Community College
  in Raleigh, North Carolina. I expect to earn my Associate degree sometime in 2025. Prior to attending Wake Tech, I served a semester at Durham Tech where
  I took a break after the term and enlisted in the Army. My occupation in the Army is a 25B, also known as an IT specialist. I spent about 22 weeks training
  as a 25B at Ft. Gordon, Georgia. My training involved troubleshooting network devices, configuring networks and networking devices, hand crafting straight 
  through and crossover cables, trunking and port security, and much more. </p>
