<h1> About Me </h1>
	<p> <h2> <li>  Background:</li> </h2> 
Hi! My name is Arham Syed and I was born in Oakland California. I spent much
of my childhood growing up in Modesto California, a small town located in the 
centeral valley, surrounded by agriculture and windfields, and known for being 
the birthplace of George Lucas. I moved to Raleigh, North Carolina at the age of 
10, where I was exposed to a more urban and technologically advanced environment.
I moved to Chapel Hill during my Junior year in high school, graduating from East 
Chapel Hill High School in the summer of 2021. I attended Durham Tech for a semester
before taking a break from college and enlisting in the Army. </p>

<h2> <li> Interests:</li> </h2> 
    My interests consist of spending time with my family, traveling, watching football, playing sports, and 
learning about subjects to better improve myself like critical thinking and philosophy. My goals in life are
to develop skills and obtain a job in the field of IT, pursue a bachelors degree, and possibly gain skills 
from other subjects as well. I believe its a good habit to expand your variety and skillsets of different 
subjects, rather than specializing in a specific subject. IT gives me the option to expand on different 
topics such as business, law, engineering, and critical thinking.
